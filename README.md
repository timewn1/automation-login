## Selenium Login Automation

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium to automate the login process for a website.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

* Node.js
* NPM
* The Selenium WebDriver package

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timewn1/automation-login.git
```
Once the repository is cloned, install the dependencies:\
```bash
npm install
```
### Running the Tests

To run the tests, simply run the following command:\
```bash
node index.js
```
This will start the Selenium WebDriver and navigate to the website. The tests will then attempt to login to the website using the provided credentials. If the login is successful, the tests will pass. If the login fails, the tests will fail.

### Troubleshooting

If you have any problems running the tests, please check the following:

* Make sure that you have the correct version of Node.js installed.
* Make sure that you have the Selenium WebDriver package installed.
* Make sure that the website you are trying to login to is accessible.
* Make sure that you have entered the correct credentials.

If you are still having problems, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.
